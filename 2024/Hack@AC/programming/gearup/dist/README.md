**gearup**

---

Lamb has been playing Diablo 4 since its release. Wolf, its friend, just started playing Diablo 4. Lamb wants to share his gears with Wolf so that their individual power levels are as close to each other as possible (because they are really close friends >.<). But if their power levels are not exactly the same, Lamb should have the higher one so it can carry Wolf.

## **Input**

Input contains 100 testcases. Each testcase starts with a single integer, _0 < t < 150_, which is the number of sub-testcases (an instance of the problem). Each sub-testcase starts with an integer _1 < n < 21_. The next line contains _n_ integers in the range _[100, 500]_, indicating the power ratings of the gears that Lamb has.

## **Output**

Output 2 integers, the first one is Lamb's power level and the second is Wolf's power level

## **Constraints**

Time limit (per input): 1 second

## **Sample testcase**

1<br>
4<br>
2 3 4 5

## **Sample output**

7 7

## **Sample explanation**

Lamb takes 2, 5 <br>
Wolf takes 3, 4
